    "# 02 - What is an Image? (Placeholder)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into Computer Vision applications and tools, it's essential to understand what an image actually is from a computational perspective. This notebook explores the fundamental concepts of digital images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coming Soon\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is under development and will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Fundamentals\n",
    "- **Pixels**: The building blocks of digital images\n",
    "- **Resolution**: Understanding image dimensions and quality\n",
    "- **Color Spaces**: RGB, Grayscale, HSV, and other representations\n",
    "- **Channels**: How color information is organized\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images as Data\n",
    "- Images as numerical arrays (NumPy arrays)\n",
    "- Data types and bit depth\n",
    "- Memory considerations and storage formats\n",
    "- Image file formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Examples\n",
    "- Loading and inspecting image data\n",
    "- Visualizing pixel values\n",
    "- Understanding image transformations at the data level\n",
    "- The relationship between visual appearance and numerical representation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand images as multi-dimensional arrays\n",
    "- Learn about different color representations\n",
    "- Grasp the connection between pixel values and visual appearance\n",
    "- Build intuition for how computers 'see' images"
