# Review Notebook for Style Compliance

Review the notebook at `$ARGUMENTS` for compliance with the course style guidelines.

## Tasks

1. Read the CLAUDE.md file to understand the style requirements
2. Open and analyze the specified notebook
3. Check for the following:
   - **Structure**: Introduction → Main Content → Exercises (optional) → Recap
   - **Self-contained**: No references to "previous notebooks"
   - **Language**: Clear, neutral English (B2-C1 level)
   - **Code**: All main narrative code runs top to bottom
   - **Images**: Use relative paths (`../images/`)
   - **TODOs**: If present, have hints but no complete solutions
   - **Explanations**: Short paragraphs, bullet lists preferred
   - **Comments**: Explain "why" not just "what"

4. Provide a structured report with:
   - Overall compliance score (1-10)
   - List of issues found (if any)
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Positive aspects of the notebook

5. Do NOT make any changes to the notebook - this is a review only
