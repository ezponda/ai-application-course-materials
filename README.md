## Course Content

### Block I: Computer Vision

This block covers the fundamentals and applications of computer vision, including:

#### Applications of Computer Vision
- Image classification and recognition
- Object detection and localization
- Image segmentation
- Facial recognition and analysis
- Optical character recognition (OCR)
- Real-world applications in healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance

#### Image Processing Libraries
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Basic image manipulation, filtering, and transformations
- **OpenCV**: Advanced computer vision operations, feature detection, and real-time processing
- Image preprocessing techniques
- Color space conversions and transformations

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- CNN architecture and components (convolution, pooling, fully-connected layers)
- Popular CNN architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, Inception)
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained models
- Building and training CNNs for image classification
- Visualization of learned features and activations

#### Object Detection and Tracking
- Object detection algorithms (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO, SSD)
- Single-shot vs. region-based detection methods
- Object tracking techniques
- Real-time detection and tracking applications
