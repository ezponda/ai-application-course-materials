    "# 07 - Computer Vision Tasks: Theory and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the theoretical foundation for understanding different Computer Vision tasks before diving into their practical implementation with Ultralytics YOLO.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coming Soon\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is under development and will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core CV Tasks\n",
    "- **Image Classification**: Assigning labels to entire images\n",
    "- **Object Detection**: Locating and classifying objects with bounding boxes\n",
    "- **Instance Segmentation**: Pixel-level object delineation\n",
    "- **Semantic Segmentation**: Classifying every pixel in an image\n",
    "- **Pose Estimation**: Detecting keypoints on objects or humans\n",
    "- **Object Tracking**: Following objects across video frames\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Foundations\n",
    "- Evolution from classification to detection\n",
    "- Understanding bounding boxes and anchor boxes\n",
    "- IoU (Intersection over Union) and evaluation metrics\n",
    "- Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)\n",
    "- The YOLO architecture family evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Considerations\n",
    "- When to use each type of task\n",
    "- Trade-offs between accuracy and speed\n",
    "- Dataset requirements and annotation formats\n",
    "- Common challenges and solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the hierarchy and relationships between CV tasks\n",
    "- Learn the theoretical concepts behind modern object detection\n",
    "- Build intuition for choosing the right task for your problem\n",
    "- Prepare for hands-on implementation in subsequent notebooks"
